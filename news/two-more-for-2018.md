After a great year of singing, we finish 2018 with two local sings, Thursday December 13th, with our great friends The Darlington Mummers at our very own Welly Folk Club and Sunday December 16th, at The Customs House, South Shields. Then a festive break, ready for lots of singing in 2019! Happy Christmas and All The Very Best for 2019 from Us lot to You lot!
