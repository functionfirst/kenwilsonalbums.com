For the last 3 years I have not been singing, either as a member of the Wilson Family or as a Solo performer. Within the last year, after much prompting, I have begun to venture out, appearing at clubs and festivals when asked.  After my 'break', although I will no longer be singing as a member of the Wilson Family, I have now, however, begun to accept Solo Bookings!

Cheers,

Ken.
