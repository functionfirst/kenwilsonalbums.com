Within the past couple of years or so and after much prompting, I have begun to venture out singing again, appearing at clubs and festivals when asked.  After my much needed 'break', I have made the decision to no longer sing as a member of the Wilson Family. I have however, begun to accept the occasional 'Solo' Booking! and with retirement from the day job at the end of 2025, I will hopefully have time to enjoy a lot more singing and artwork!

Cheers,

Ken.
