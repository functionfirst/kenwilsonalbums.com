After more visits to hospital and more tests! I have now been diagnosed with having 'Rheumatoid Arthritis' - Although it is not the result I was hoping for, it is an Arthritis that can be treated! I will still be having a break from gigs (Solo or Wilson Family) for a while! until things settle down....I look forward to seeing you sooner rather than later! Ken.
