Within the last year or so, and after much prompting, I have begun to venture out singing again, appearing at clubs and festivals when asked.  After my much needed 'break', I will no longer be singing as a member of the Wilson Family, I have now, however, begun to accept the occasional 'Solo' Booking!

Cheers,

Ken.
