I am looking forward to this 'solo' gig at the Potteries folk club next Friday 11th October!



As a lot of you may know I have been suffering with my knee(s) lately, with little improvement! They are telling me it is Osteoarthritis, and I have now had injections into both knees! After taking advice from my consultant, I have decided that Friday will be my last gig (Solo or Wilson Family) for a while! until they sort my knees out or I find another way of coping with it!...It's been a busy summer, and all the standing and traveling has not helped! I am sure things will improve as long as I give it a chance....so I look forward to seeing you sooner rather than later! Ken.
