Four or five years ago I made the decision to no longer sing as a member of the Wilson Family group, and at the same time decided to take a break from singing altogether and spend more time doing some artwork. Within the past couple of years or so and after much prompting from  good friends, I have began to venture out singing again! appearing at clubs and festivals when asked....So after my much needed 'break', I have started to accept the occasional booking 'solo' or 'duo' with Jim MacFarland!....enjoying the singing and good company once again. With retirement from the day job approaching at the end of 2025, I will hopefully have lots of time to enjoy my singing and artwork!

Cheers,

Ken.
