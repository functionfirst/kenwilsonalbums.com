This album is a collection of songs, some of which I have been singing for the past
33 years and others I have collected along the way. As a young lad back in the seventies,
going to my first folk clubs and festivals I was heavily influenced by all these songs
that I hadn't heard before and the style they were being sung in by the likes of Fred
Jordan, The Watersons, Swan Arcade, Martin Carthy, Peter Bellamy, to name but a few.

I could go on but undoubtedly the greatest impact on me, was the late, great Tony Rose. In my
mind, the finest singer of folk songs I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. He is sadly
missed. As a member of the Wilson Family, I have recorded many times over the years but this is
the first time I have entered a recording studio to record a solo album. As the album title, Not
Before Time suggests, I have been told on numerous occasions by friends and family, not least by
my beloved partner Chris, that I should record these songs.

So, I dedicate this album to Chris and our collective family Adam, Lee, Barrie, Alan and Sian,
whom I love dearly. Special thanks to Barrie & Ingrid Temple, for their kind words of encouragement
prior to and during this recording.
