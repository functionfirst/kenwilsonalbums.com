          It is a year ago that I merged two of my sketches together.
          <strong>Vin Garbutt</strong> and the
          <strong>Transporter Bridge</strong>, both icons of Teesside and created a canvas print entitled
          <strong>Voice of the Tees</strong>.

        <h2>South Cleveland Heart Fund Presentation</h2>

        <p class="my-4">
          On September 4th 2020, Pat Garbutt, Chris and I, met with Dr Adrian Davies (chairman) and other members of the
          <em>South Cleveland Heart Fund</em>,
          to present them with a cheque for
          <strong>Â£2,064.45</strong>, from the sale of the
          <strong>Voice of the Tees</strong> canvas prints.
          <em>Thank you all!</em>

        <p
          class="my-4"
        >The presentation took place in the shadow of the Transporter Bridge, due to the ongoing restrictions in place at James Cook Hospital.</p>
