      <p class="my-4">
        Two icons of Teesside 'Vin Garbutt' and the 'Transporter Bridge'
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        I have merged two of my sketches together to create this 18 x 16 (46cm x 41cm) canvas print - 'Voice of the Tees'
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        I have spoken to Vin's wife Pat, and with her blessing we have agreed to make this available as a 'Limited edition' of 250 copies! On a 'first come first served basis'
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Lots of you will know that Vin spent a lot of time, being looked after by our wonderful NHS nurses, doctors and staff, at the Cardiology Department of James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough. Over the past couple years, I have also needed the services of these wonderful people. So, again with Pats blessing I have decided to donate 50% of all profits from the sale of these prints, to 'Cardiology Department' of the James Cook Hospital!
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        If, or hopefully when we reach the 250th copy – I will produce 1 no. Larger copy of the print with a card of all the names of the 250 people who purchased a copy, and along with a Cheque, Pat and I will present it to the Cardiology Department of the James Cook Hospital.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Please allow Two – Three weeks for delivery, from the day you order your copy. Thank you,
      </p>
