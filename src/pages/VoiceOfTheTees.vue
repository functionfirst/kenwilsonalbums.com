          Two icons of Teesside <em>Vin Garbutt</em> and the <em>Transporter Bridge</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl italic">
          I have merged two of my sketches together to create this 18 x 16 (46cm x 41cm) canvas print - <em>Voice of the Tees</em>
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
          I have spoken to Vin's wife Pat, and with her blessing we have agreed to make this available as a
          <span class="font-bold">Limited edition</span> of 250 copies! On a <em>first come first served basis</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
          Lots of you will know that Vin spent a lot of time, being looked after by our wonderful NHS nurses, doctors
          and staff, at the Cardiology Department of James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough. Over the past couple years,
          I have also needed the services of these wonderful people. So, again with Pats blessing I will be
          donating 50% of all profits from the sale of these prints, to the <em>Cardiology Department</em> of the James Cook Hospital!
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
          If, or hopefully <em>when</em> we reach the 250th copy - I will produce 1 no. Larger copy of the print with a card
          of all the names of the 250 people who purchased a copy, and along with a Cheque, Pat and I will present
          it to the Cardiology Department of the James Cook Hospital.
        </p>

        <p class="my-4">
          Please allow Two â€“ Three weeks for delivery, from the day you order your copy.

          Thank you,<br>
