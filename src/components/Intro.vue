      <p class="leading-loose">
        Sadly our sister Josephine died in infancy. I attended school in Billingham, where I developed a passion for sports and art, which continued until my early twenties. I became involved in the folk scene in the mid 1970`s and along with my siblings, The Wilson Family, frequented folk clubs and festivals throughout Great Britain and Europe, producing several albums on the way. Due to this and my work and family commitments art work took a back seat at this point.
